Help me to trust in Your plans for me, knowing that You work all things together for my good. "For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."

(Philippians 4:13) May Your peace that surpasses all understanding guard my heart and mind, enabling me to focus on the task at hand. "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go." (Joshua 1:9) In Jesusâ€™ name, amen.',
